# Evil Niche

## Project Summary
Like what our title says, Evil Niche unveils the most crime-ridden counties/communities in Florida and other regions of the United States. The project will take in county data and determine what are the best places to commit certain kinds of crimes such as larceny or homicide. It will also indicate different features of each county that make it beneficial for would-be criminals to commit their crime of choice there. The project will provide a visual view of the cities.

## Description
There is a serious lack of information about the weak points of law enforcement. There are many areas across the country where it is easy to get away with certain types of crime. Evil Niche gives people the ability to input their desired crime (along with any supported supplemental data such as demographics) and it tells them what is the best place to commit that crime. Evil Niche defines the “best place” as the place that provides the lowest chance of them getting caught. Through this application, Evil Niche offers data to advise local governments, police departments, and the general denizens of an area. It helps people understand the weak spots in their local community.
